			✔ what hashing function? mpv uses md5 on full path of the file @done(23-01-12 09:31)
			☐ better hash
				✔ try to normalize the path? still won't help if the file is moved @done(23-01-22 23:54)

		✔ option to enable/disable autoloading @done(23-01-19 10:26)
		✘ abort if file already has chapters? @cancelled(23-01-19 12:52)
			we are loading before the properties are accessible, so can't check if file has chapters
				it would require manual parsing or reloading the file

			☐ mac?
		✔ create copy of the file in the same directory with chapters baked in @done(23-01-08 22:12)
			✘ do it without writing the chapters file or write it to temporary file - ffmpeg can't edit in place @cancelled(23-01-14 15:38)
				☐ os.tmpname() maybe?
		✘ explore mkvtool for the job as possible alternative to ffmpeg @cancelled(23-01-13 16:51)
			is it installed on user's system? ffmpeg should be guaranteed to be there
